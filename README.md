# Turing-Machine
A project to build a Turing machine (hopefully universal) in C++

### Goals
* To build a Turing machine that can execute a language
  * To build a Turing machine that can mimic any other Turing Machine (and thus make it universal)
* To build a helpful visualization tool that can show the execution of a Turing machine as an educational resource
* Improve my fluency in C++

### Libraries
* [JSON for Modern C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
* [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
